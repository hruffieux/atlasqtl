Must be \code{NULL} if \code{list_init} and \code{list_hyper} are both

entry is the type of schedule: 1 = geometric spacing (default), 
2 = harmonic spacing or 3 = linear spacing, the second entry is the initial 
temperature (default is 2), and the third entry is the temperature grid 
size (default is 10). If \code{NULL}, no annealing is performed.}

all parameters are returned.}

\item{thinned_elbo_eval}{If \code{TRUE}, the convergence criterion 
(variational lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood, or ELBO) is not

after a given batch of iterations where the batch size is set in an 
adaptive fashion accounting for the number of iterations roughly expected 
until convergence.}

Default is \code{NULL}, for no checkpointing.}

\description{
Flexible sparse regression for hierarchically-related responses using 
annealed variational inference.
}
\details{
\code{atlasqtl} implements a flexible hierarchical regression 
  framework that allows information-sharing across responses and predictors, 
  thereby enhancing the detection of weak effects. \code{atlasqtl} is 
  tailored to the detection of hotspot predictors, i.e., predictors 
  associated with many responses: it is based on a fully Bayesian model 
  whereby the hotspot propensity is modelled using the horseshoe shrinkage 
  prior: its global-local formulation shrinks noise globally and hence can 
  accommodate highly sparse settings, while being robust to individual 
  signals, thus leaving the effects of hotspots unshrunk. Inference is 
  carried out using a scalable variational algorithm coupled with a novel 
  simulated annealing procedure, which is applicable to large dimensions, 
  i.e., thousands of response variables, and allows efficient exploration of 
  multimodal distributions.

  The columns of the response matrix \code{Y} are centered within the 
  \code{atlasqtl} call, and the columns of the candidate predictor matrix 
  \code{X} are standardized.
