\title{atlasqtl: an R package for variable selection in sparse regression with hierarchically-related responses}
\description{
Flexible sparse regression for variable selection in large predictor and 
response settings, based on a series of hierarchically-related spike-and-slab 
submodels. The model is also tailored to the detection of hotspots, namely, 
predictors associated with multiple responses, which it represents using a 
global-local horseshoe specification. Inference uses closed-form variational 
updates coupled with a simulated annealing algorithm to enhance exploration of 
highly multimodal spaces. This software allows joint inference at large scale, 
e.g., for molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies, where the hotspots 
are genetic variants regulating several molecular traits simultaneously. 
See H. Ruffieux, A. C. Davison, J. Hager, J. Inshaw, B. Fairfax, S. Richardson, 
and L. Bottolo. A global-local approach for detecting hotspots in multiple 
response regression. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 14:905-928, 2020.
