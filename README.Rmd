## Overview

*atlasqtl* is an R package for joint molecular QTL mapping in eQTL, pQTL or mQTL studies. The method is tailored to the detection of weak genetic effects, including pleiotropic effects, exerted by QTL hotspots that control multiple molecular traits. It implements a scalable Bayesian hierarchical model for variable selection in high-dimensional multi-response regression.

The model uses a horseshoe shrinkage formulation to share information across co-regulated traits, thereby flexibly adapting to the sparse nature of genetic signals. It efficiently handles thousands of genetic variants and molecular phenotypes through batch variational inference, coupled with simulated annealing to better explore complex parameter landscapes.
The R package calls C++ subroutines for computational efficiency.

## Warning

**This is a development branch**, it is not guaranteed to be stable at any given 
time and features are subject to change. Please use the 
[stable version](https://github.com/hruffieux/atlasqtl), unless you want to test 
and report issues.


## Installation

**Important note:** the R package depends on the GSL library which needs to be 
manually installed. For example on Ubuntu,

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```

or on mac, 

``` bash
$ brew install gsl
```

after having installed Homebrew.


Then, to install the package in R, run the following command:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hruffieux/atlasqtl", ref = "devel")
```

## Example repository 

For a hands-on introduction to *atlasqtl*, check out our [example repository](https://github.com/hruffieux/software_corner_ibs_bulletin), which 
contains a step-by-step illustration of the method in a QTL mapping setting.
