## Overview

**atlasqtl** is an R package implementing a scalable hierarchical
modelling framework for variable selection in regression problems with
many predictors and many responses. The method is tailored to the
detection of hotspots, i.e., predictors associated with several
responses. The *hotspot propensity* of each candidate predictor is
modelled using a horseshoe distribution (Carvalho et al.Â  2009), whose
local scale flexibly models the large hotspot effects and whose global
scale adapts to the overall signal sparsity. Inference is performed
using efficient batch variational inference updates which are coupled
with simulated annealing schemes to improve the exploration of
multimodal parameter spaces.

The method can be employed in any sparse multiple-response regression
setting, and is particularly suited to large molecular quantitative
trait locus (QTL) problems, in which hotspot genetic variants,
controlling many molecular levels at once, may be responsible for
decisive regulatory mechanisms. Hence, our approach is a tool that can
help towards understanding the functional architecture underlying
complex traits and outlining a *hotspot atlas* of the human genome.

## Warning

**This is a development branch**, it is not guaranteed to be stable at
any given time and features are subject to change. Please use the
[stable version](https://github.com/hruffieux/atlasqtl), unless you want
to test and report issues.

## Installation

**Important note:** the R package depends on the GSL library which needs
to be manually installed. For example on Ubuntu,

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```

or on mac,

``` bash
$ brew install gsl
```

after having installed Homebrew.

Then, to install the package in R, run the following command:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hruffieux/atlasqtl", ref = "original-version-no-opt-large-n-no-missingness-handling")
```
